Sample Questions:
-What’s one thing we must get right—right now—to make sure the 2026 World Cup doesn’t just come and go, but leaves Canadian soccer in a better place?
-After the final match is played, what will determine whether this World Cup was a success for Toronto—not just as an event, but as a catalyst for long-term impact?
To Marcus Hanson:
You’ve worked directly with young athletes trying to break through in Canada. What do you see as the biggest barriers for kids—especially from underserved communities—trying to make it in the game today?


You’ve helped players land spots at top universities and pro clubs. What systems or support structures are working right now—and where is the biggest gap?
To Dwayne De Rosario (Player Development & Role Modeling):
You came up through the community leagues in Scarborough and reached the highest levels. What do you think has changed for young Canadian players since your time—and what hasn’t?


You’ve stayed active in the game post-retirement, working with youth. How important is it to have visible Canadian role models, and do you feel we’re doing enough to nurture local talent?
 When Canada plays in 2026, it’ll be on home soil. Emotionally, what do you think that will mean for our players—and for young kids watching?
To Sharon Bollenbach:
You’ve overseen major national events before, but the FIFA World Cup is another level. What are the key priorities in ensuring Toronto is not only a host—but a host that’s ready?


A lot of people focus on stadiums and transit—but you’ve spoken about the “soft infrastructure” of hosting. What does legacy look like from your perspective, beyond the games themselves?

4:00 - 4:40: Panel #3: From The Ground Up: How To Build a Global Sports Nation
In recent years, Toronto has made bold moves that signal its evolution into a true global sports capital — from the launch of the PWHL and the announcement of a WNBA expansion team, to the NHL’s renewed focus on international competition through the Four Nations Face-Off. And in the next two years, that momentum reaches a new peak, as the city prepares to host World Cup matches in 2026 — arguably the most significant international sporting event in its history.
This conversation brings together leaders building Toronto’s sports future from every angle: major league expansion, global partnerships, grassroots development, and equity-driven advocacy. Together, they’ll explore what it means to turn a city into a global sports hub — not just by hosting the world, but by ensuring that storytelling, access, investment, and community are at the heart of its growth.
This is about how Toronto can create a legacy that lasts well beyond the final whistle.

Sample Questions:
To Teresa
You’ve been part of building major teams before, but the Toronto Tempo is a historic first. What does it mean to you — and to Canada — to launch the WNBA’s first international franchise, and how are you laying the foundation for long-term success from day one?


“Toronto has hosted NBA All-Star, an NBA championship parade, and now it's gearing up for a WNBA team. What does building community around basketball in this city actually look like — and how can we ensure it’s rooted in more than just fandom?”
To  Kyle 
The NHL has made a renewed push into international markets with the Four Nations Face-Off and other events. How do you see global competition contributing to Toronto’s positioning as a global sports hub?


In your work bridging club-level sales with national and global partnerships, how do you ensure local cities like Toronto benefit from international strategies — and what untapped potential do you see here?
To Saroya:
You’ve been at the forefront of hockey’s evolution — both on the ice and as a force for change. What lessons from your own experience are shaping how you help grow the game in Toronto, especially for underrepresented communities?


With the launch of the PWHL, we’re seeing a new model of professional women’s hockey. What’s the most important thing to get right in the early stages of a league if the goal is to create a long-lasting, inclusive sports ecosystem?
To the group:
Toronto is getting a lot of attention — WNBA expansion, the PWHL, World Cup matches. But how do we ensure that this isn’t just a moment — that it actually builds a legacy that benefits the city long-term?


We often hear about access and equity as priorities — but what does that actually mean in the context of investment, storytelling, and infrastructure? Who needs to be at the table?


What do global sports fans want from a city like Toronto — and how can we meet that demand without losing sight of the local, grassroots community?


If you had to choose one thing Toronto must get right in the next 24 months to truly become a global sports nation, what would it be?
To Diana:
"You’ve gone from being a national team star to launching a pro league. When you were building the Northern Super League, what were the biggest gaps you saw in Canada’s sports infrastructure — and how did you try to address them from day one?"


"Professional women’s soccer is finally taking root in Canada, and it’s happening in lockstep with the rise of other women’s leagues like the WNBA and PWHL. What does this moment mean to you — and what do you think makes this surge different from past attempts?"


"Toronto is about to be on the world stage during the 2026 FIFA World Cup. How do we ensure that the impact of that tournament translates into meaningful investment in the women’s game, rather than being a missed opportunity?"


"Storytelling has been a core part of Project 8 and the Northern Super League’s identity — from player narratives to community roots. Why was that such a priority, and how do you see storytelling shaping the fanbase for women’s soccer in Canada?"







4:45 - 5:30 PM: Panel #4: Canada Soccer Preparation for FIFA World Cup 
With the FIFA World Cup on the horizon and Canada taking its place among the world’s top footballing nations, this panel explores what it truly means to prepare—not just for the tournament, but for a moment that could reshape the future of soccer in this country.
Head Coach Jesse Marsch shares what it’s like to lead a national team with the hopes of a country behind it, and how he's thinking about culture, connection, and long-term impact—not just wins and losses. He’s joined by Bob Park, Chief Brand Officer at GE Appliances Canada, one of Canada Soccer’s key supporters, to speak to why investing in the sport—and in the people behind it—matters now more than ever.
Moderated by respected sports broadcaster Andi Petrillo, this conversation will explore the potential of the World Cup to shift how Canadians engage with the game, how we support athletes at every level, and how this moment could be a catalyst for something much bigger than soccer.
This panel is about more than preparing a team for a tournament; it's about preparing a nation to step confidently into a new era of sport, identity, and possibility.

Sample Questions:

-This World Cup has the potential to be a defining moment for the country—not just in sports, but in how Canadians see themselves. What do you each hope this moment sparks across Canada?
-How do we ensure that this isn’t just a “moment,” but a movement that lifts the sport, its athletes, and its communities for years to come?

Beyond wins and losses, what does success look like to you in 2026?


As you look at Canada’s emerging talent pool, what excites you most about the future of Canadian soccer—and where do we need to level up?


 To Bob:
GE Appliances has made a significant investment in Canadian soccer. What drove that decision—and what do you see in this moment that made now the right time to step in?


Sponsorship is often seen as just logos and visibility, but you've spoken about supporting “the people behind the game.” What does that look like in practice?


How do you think brands can help shape a sports culture—not just reflect it?


In your view, what role should corporate partners play in building a legacy beyond the tournament—especially at the community or youth level?
